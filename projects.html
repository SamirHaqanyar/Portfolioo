            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Samir Haqanyar, and I am a software development student
              at Green River College. I'm passionate about creating engaging and
              interactive digital experiences. With a background in software
              development, I've honed my skills in both front-end and back-end
              development. I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new
              technologies to bring innovative solutions to life.

            <h3>Computer Hardware Project</h3>
            <p>
              Description: Developed a database project focusing on computer
              hardware. Employed SQL, Excel, Tableau, and other tools to extract
              meaningful insights from the database and make up answers to
              certain questions.

            <h3>Housing Data set</h3>
            <p>
              Description: This Python script analyzes and visualizes the data
              of houses in a CSV file. The following five features can be
              founded: comparing house prices against the areas by creating a
              scatter plot; summarizing statistics like the average and median
              prices and sizes; showing the price based on furnishing status
              using a bar chart; filter the house based on price range; and
              filter based on area range. The script plays with data
              visualization through Matplotlib and is well-commented for
              clarity. This is therefore a valuable resource for anyone handling
              data on housing.
